# color picker

this is a simple color generator/selector that i created in a couple minutes using react.

it's a pretty simple tool that lets you generate new colors by just clicking.

if you find a color you like, you can click the hex code to copy it to your clipboard

### party mode
by clicking on the party button you can enable party mode, which will change the color every few seconds, pressing on it again will stop the party.

### custom components/hooks

theres a couple custom hooks/components i created while making this, most notably the Toast component and the useToast. feel free to copy them and use them in your own projects. it should be pretty easy to figure out how they work by looking at how i used them here

  - p.s. i know my code is a bit messy, i'll clean it up later (i won't lol)

Hope you enjoy!
